### Git: The Basics


### Introduction
Git is a free open-source version control system. It is used by most developers and programmers these days since this is easy and more efficient than other version control systems. While git stores its data, most of the version control systems these days like Mercurial, TFS, Perforce, and Bazaar are delta-based version control systems. And since git is free, anyone can use it after of course they learn how to. It saves all the code changes and makes them accessible to us. 
In git, we first save an initial version of the code, and over time we keep updating the code which will be tracked. We can see every change we made each time and if we want, we can also go back to the previous version of our code. This is the most required way to keep track of what changes we made to the code from the beginning to date. If you see a bug in your code, you can go back to the previous version, and then since you can see all the changes you made, you can easily track down the bug. Not only for the bugs but sometimes you need to go back because you realize the previous version was better and more efficient than the present one. You can also go back to the beginning, i.e., the start of your code. 
In todayâ€™s world, multiple developers merge their work for the best results and git helps to run the same code in a parallel way so that the tracking would be easy.
